# Shangri-la HTML5/JS version

The Bridges of Shangri-la is a board game created by Leo Colovini and published by 999 Games (amongst others). More info is available on [Boardgamegeek.com](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8190/the-bridges-of-shangri-la).

As a fun exercise and to familiarize myself with building games in HTML5/JS, I've set out to recreate this game in a digital form pure as a hobby.

Started building this. Created a HTML5 canvas abstract map version of the Shangri-la map with 13 villages and 23 villages, based on relative distances measured from the actual board. I've put in most of the basics, now it's time to look at the nodeJS (or meteorJS?) side of things.
